# TITLE 

One of the best ways of learning is to start with a challenge and learn the steps of solving that challenge. 

* They provide clear learning objects for the learner: learners are given a clear goal to achieve. 
* When linked with scaffolded training, learners don't have to worry about going down the wrong path
* Promotes active learning 
* Fosters problem solving skills

## Prerequisite learning

To solve the following challenge, you will need to complete the following cookbooks: 

* 

## Challenge

Create a program that turns on an LED corresponding to the distance sensed by the distance sensor. The LED brightness should vary depending on the value of the potentiometer.

Use one potentiometer to control the brightness of the LEDs (for example, pin A0).

Use three distance sensors to measure distance (for example, pins A1, A2, and A3).

Use a for loop to iterate through each distance sensor in sequence.
Use the analogRead() function to read the values of the potentiometer and distance sensors.

Use the map() function to map the potentiometer value to the LED brightness value.

Use the analogWrite() function to set the brightness of the LEDs.
