# Introduction to Dictionaries challenges 

One of the best ways of learning is to start with a challenge and learn the steps of solving that challenge. 

* They provide clear learning objects for the learner: learners are given a clear goal to achieve. 
* When linked with scaffolded training, learners don't have to worry about going down the wrong path
* Promotes active learning 
* Fosters problem solving skills

## Challenge

### Introduction to dictionaries challenge 

#### Prerequisite learning

To solve the following challenges, you will need to complete the following cookbooks: 

* ["Simple introductions"](../../cookbook/python/foundations/foundations.dictionaries.simple.md)
* [Accessing a value with a key](../../cookbook/python/foundations/foundations.dictionaries.accessing_a_value.md)
* [Adding a new key value pair](../../cookbook/python/foundations/foundations.dictionaries.adding_new_key_value_pair.md)

**Person**:  Use a dictionary to store information about a person you know. Store their first name, last name, age, and the city in which they live. You should have keys such as first_name, last_name, age , and city. Print each piece of information stored in your dictionary.

**Favorite Numbers**: Use a dictionary to store people’s favorite numbers. Think of five names, and use them as keys in your dictionary. Think of a favorite number for each person, and store each as a value in your dictionary. Print each person’s name and their favorite number. For even more fun, poll a few friends and get some actual data for your program.

Glossary: A Python dictionary can be used to model an actual dictionary. However, to avoid confusion, let’s call it a glossary.

* Think of five programming words you’ve learned about in the previous chapters. Use these words as the keys in your glossary, and store their meanings as values.
* Print each word and its meaning as neatly formatted output. You might print the word followed by a colon and then its meaning, or print the word on one line and then print its meaning indented on a second line. Use the
newline character (\n) to insert a blank line between each word-meaning pair in your output.


### Intermediate dictionaries challenge 

#### Prerequisite learning

To solve the following challenges, you will need to complete the following cookbooks: 

* [Looping through lists](../../cookbook/python/foundations/foundations.dictionaries.looping.md)

**Glossary 2**: Rewrite your previous challenge so it uses a loop to print out all five of the words you know. 

**Rivers**: Make a dictionary containing three major rivers and the country each river runs through. (i.e., 'nile', 'egypt')

* Use a loop to print a sentence about each river such as "The Nile runs through Egypt"
* Use a loop to print the name of each river included in the dictionary
* Use a loop to print the name of each country included in the dictionary

### Compound dictionaries challenge 

#### Prerequisite learning

To solve the following challenges, you will need to complete the following cookbooks: 

* [Nesting Dictionaries](../../cookbook/python/foundations/foundations.dictionaries.nesting_in_dictionaries.md)

**Pets**: make several dictionaries where each dictionary represent a different pet. In each dictionary, include the kind of animal and the owner's name. Store these dictionaries in a list called pets. Then, loop through your list and as you do print everything you know about each pet. 

**Cities**: Make a dictionary called cities. Use the names of three cities as keys in your dictionary. Create an additional, nested, dictionary which contains information about each city such as the population, the country it is in, and a fact about that city.
