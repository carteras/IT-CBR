# How do we pull apart strings?

One of the best ways of learning is to start with a challenge and learn the steps of solving that challenge.

* They provide clear learning objects for the learner: learners are given a clear goal to achieve.
* When linked with scaffolded training, learners don't have to worry about going down the wrong path
* Promotes active learning
* Fosters problem solving skills

## Prerequisite learning

To solve the following challenge, you may need to complete the following cookbooks:

* printing and variables
* conditions
* using modules
* string functions
* strings as lists
* [splitting strings](../../../cookbook/python/foundations/foundations.strings.splitting_strings.md)
* simple regular expressions
* [Reading the source of a HTML page](../../../cookbook/web/cookbook.web.reading_source_files.md)

## Challenge

You need to use the following string to find all of the non-unique sequences and put them together. Your flag should look a little like this: 

ctfCBRC{SOME_UNIQUE_WORDS_GO_HERE}
