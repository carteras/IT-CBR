# How do we download files?

One of the best ways of learning is to start with a challenge and learn the steps of solving that challenge.

* They provide clear learning objects for the learner: learners are given a clear goal to achieve.
* When linked with scaffolded training, learners don't have to worry about going down the wrong path
* Promotes active learning
* Fosters problem solving skills

## Prerequisite learning

To solve the following challenge, you will need to complete the following cookbooks:

* printing and variables
* conditions
* iteration
* using modules
* Pulling apart strings
* reading and writing files
* [Downloading files with requests](../../cookbook/python/python.downloading.requests.md)

## Challenge

Download the following from GitHub and the flag will be the contents of the file. Your final output should look something like this:

[practice.challenge.download.me.txt](files/practice.challenge.download.me.txt)

`cbrcCBR{your_flag_goes_here}`

Note, in later versions of this, the flag will be password protected or encrypted.

Your answer is in the source:
