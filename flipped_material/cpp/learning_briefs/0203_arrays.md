# Arrays

## Learning Goals

*By the end of this module you should be able to answer the following:*

* How can pointers and references be useful? 
* What is the difference between primitive and complex data structures?
* What is a string?
* How can you construct a string or array in C?
* How you can access different parts of an array?
* How do you pass an array from one function to another?

## Code

*It is important to practice code and challenge our brain in new ways. Do all of the problems below, including the example problems. They will make you a better programmer.*

### Example Problems

*Example problems are best if you code them up yourself and store them. Don't just copy and paste, code them in and make them work. If you are really smart about it, you'll remake them slightly differently to really establish your learning.*

### Practice Problems

*Practice questions are essential to mastering a skill. Often, you will be asked to do things you haven't exactly done yet, or not at all. Be challenged by it and see if you can get google, the person next to you, or the teacher, to help before you stop working.*
