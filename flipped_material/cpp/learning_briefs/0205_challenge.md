# Challenge 2

## Create a program that does the following

* Accepts a string
* Stores it as a char[]
* converts it all to capital letters
* checks to see if it is a Palindrome

Note: You should use prior learning briefs to gauge what is "at level".

Palindrome: A word, sentence, or longer written work that reads the same backwards. Example: A declaration facetiously attributed to Napoleon, "Able was I ere I saw Elba." Weird Al Yankovic's song "Bob" spoofs Bob Dylan's "Subterranean Homesick Blues" using a slew of palindromes. Need more palindromes? Find a huge stash here.

## Extra spiciness

If you want to flex your nerdfu you could attempt the following:

* checks to see if it is an Isogram
* checks to see if it is a Pangram



Isogram:  A word in which no letter of the alphabet occurs more than once. Dimitri Borgmann's longest example: dermatoglyphics, the study of skin markings or patterns on fingers, hands, and feet, and its application, especially in criminology.

Pangram: A phrase or sentence containing all 26 letters of the alphabet (ideally repeating as few letters as possible). You may remember this one from typing class: "The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy sleeping dog," but Willard Espy came up with a shorter and more interesting one: "Bawds jog, flick quartz, vex nymphs." An abundance of pangrams, using some very obscure words or initials can be found here.
