# I've never heard of python. Is it popular?

Python is used in lots of cool places.
Google, Industrial Light & Magic, YouTube,
and NASA (to name a few) all use Python. 

# So, when I’m done with this book I’ll throw Python away and use something else, like C# or Java?

Only if you want to. Python might be
the only programming language you’ll ever
need. But, yes, if you want to learn another
programming language, you can take
everything you learn about programming in
this book and apply it to any other language
with the minimum of effort.

# There seems to be many different versions of Python. Which should I use?

The highest version. Python 3.8+

# What does int(g) mean?

It tells Python to interpret the user’s input as a number rather than a letter. Within programming languages, the number 5 is different than the letter ‘5’.

# So what if we’d left it out?

**Try it**

The computer would have treated the
input entered by the user of the program as
a letter. If you ask the computer if a letter
is equal to a number, it gets confused and
tells you it isn’t.

Because if the computer thinks that
two pieces of information are of different
“types,” it assumes that there’s no way they
can be equal.

# So what if I had not typed a number when I was asked for a guess? What if I’d just entered my name or something?

**Try it**

The code would have crashed with an
error. In fact, Python will complain that the
program crashed with a “ValueError” (more
on these error messages later in the book).
