## Factory methods

Factory Methods are one of the most used Design Patterns. This type of design pattern comes under creational patterns as this pattern provides one of the best ways to create appropriate objects. 

In the Factory pattern, we create objects without exposing the creation logic to the client and refer to newly created objects using a common interface. 

### Implementation

We are going to create a Dog factory. We will create Dogs based off of input in a method factory.
