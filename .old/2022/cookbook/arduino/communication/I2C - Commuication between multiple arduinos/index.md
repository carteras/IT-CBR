# I2C Comunications Guide for Beginners

To follow this guide a section has been created for each stage of learning know as a lesson, each lesson then has a video tutorial known as a learning brief and video challenge to be completed. 

It is recomended after completing the learing brief in each lesson that you should attempt the learning challenge included in the second video. After completing all the lessons you should have the knowledge needed to complete the Final learning challenge.

## Lesson 1
Lesson 1 includes a breif outline of the basic knowledge needed for I2C as well as teches the very basics of sending a message via I2C

#### Extra Challenge: Add more buttons to turn on more LEDs

## Lesson 2
Lesson 2 expands on the knowledge of Lesson 1 and teaches how to request information from the slave. After this lesson it shouold be possible to acheive back and forth communication with the Master sending and requesting data from the slave.

#### Extra Challenge: Map the Ultra Sonic sensor to cycle between 5 LEDs depending on distance

## Lesson 3
The Final Lesson shows how to physically wire up the arduino meagas used in class as well as program arduinos for a multi slave I2C network. after completing this lesson you should have all the knowledge needed for the final challenge
