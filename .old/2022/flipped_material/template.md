*It is important to practice code and challenge our brain in new ways. Do all of the problems below, including the example problems. They will make you a better programmer.*

### Example Problems

### Practice Problems

*Practice questions are essential to mastering a skill. Often, you will be asked to do things you haven't exactly done yet, or not at all. Be challenged by it and see if you can get google, the person next to you, or the teacher, to help before you stop working.*
