#### Challenge 2

Create a program that reads from the text document "class_grades.txt". 

* Find who has the highest score in the class and what their score was. 
* Find the average of all scores 
* Find the standard deviation of all scores (note, check python modules)
* Find the z scores of each student (try not to use pandas, numpy, or scipi)
* Use python to write a file with that information in the following format: 
  * > Lastname, Adam: score, z-score
* Bonus kudos if the text file is in highest to lowest order
