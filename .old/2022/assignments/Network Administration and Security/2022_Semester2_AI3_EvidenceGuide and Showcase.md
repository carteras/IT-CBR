**Task**

You have been tasked with solving a series of challenges on picoCTF. You
will use your learning outputs as evidence to guide the marker to what
you have learned and at what level and to highlight/market your learning
to non-technical third parties.

You should treat this assignment as Assignment Item 3 (Evidence Guide)
and Assignment Item 4 (Innovation Showcase).

At a minimum, you must complete CTF activities covering web
exploitation, cryptography, reverse engineering, and forensics.
Furthermore, it is recommended that you complete the following CTFs

-   Web Exploitation: don\'t-use-client-side and picobrowser

-   Cryptography: la cifra de and john pollard

-   Reverse Engineering: vault-door3 and vault-door 4

-   Forensics: so meta and extensions

Note you may need to do other activities to learn or refresh the skills
to complete these tasks.

A second note: You may choose to complete other (or more) tasks at your
discretion.

**Each must include the following at a minimum**

-   Evidence of your project/work over the term

    -   A writeup/explanation of each problem solved

    -   A bibliography of any supporting documentation that you used (if
        in doubt, use APA 5^th^)

    -   Video evidence of your solution in its most complete format.

-   A series of short journals responding to different unit
    goals/descriptors/etc.

-   An Evidence Guide (PowerPoint)

-   Innovation Showcase Poster and Presentation (Poster + video(s))

# Tool of learning

The best learning happens when we stop and think about what we\'ve done,
what worked, what didn\'t, and what we would do next time.

With this in mind, the lion\'s share of marks will focus on what you\'ve
learned in the project process, with the project itself being the
journey and not the destination.

## Submission Guide

#### Journal responses

The journal responses will be asking questions similar to the questions
below. They are used to prepare to look at your work and produce your
Evidence Guide and Innovation Showcases.

#### Evidence Guide and Innovation Showcase

The Evidence Guide and the Innovation Showcase rely on you responding to
some questions. The questions are the same for both sections, but you
will answer them differently. These questions will be heavily based on
the goals and content of the unit. In this case, we are using the Unit
Goals from Digital Technologies: Structured Project

1.  What is it you did this term, and what did you learn?

2.  How may your learning impact your understanding of Network
    Administration and Security?

3.  What is Web Exploitation OR Digital Forensics, and why is it
    essential for Network Administrators to understand?

4.  What is Cryptography OR Reverse Engineering?, and why is it
    beneficial for Technology professionals to understand?

5.  What is Risk Assessment, and why is it essential for Network
    Administration and Security?

6.  What management strategies did you use to keep yourself, or put
    yourself back on, track? How/why did this impact you?

##### Evidence Guide

Evidence Guides are a personal response to the questions above. However,
they focus on reporting to a technical expert (me) on what you\'ve done
this semester.

In this case, the Evidence Guide must be completed in a PowerPoint
format (or similar analog). You must answer **four** questions, but only
**two** are mandatory: \"What is it that you did this term, and what did
you learn\" and \"How may your learning impact your understanding of
Network Administration and Security?\". You may select which of the
other two questions you want to respond to in a technical format. The
remaining two questions must be answered in your showcase.

Each question can contain no more than three slides. On top of the style
guide requirements (found below the rubric), you may include a short
passage in the author\'s notes to extrapolate the idea further. However,
each question can have no more than 250 words in total.

##### Innovation Showcase

Innovation Showcases are focused on informing people with a diverse
understanding of technology. It must be helpful for someone in year ten
coming to an open night but informative for your peers to understand the
cool things you\'ve done.

Unlike the evidence guide, you do not need to respond to all the
questions above. You must answer **four** questions, but only **two**
can be repeated: \"What is it that you did this term and what did you
learn\" and \"How may your learning impact your understanding of Network
Administration and Security?\". The other two questions must be ones you
haven\'t addressed from the list above.

Innovation Showcases will consist of 1 or more connected posters based
on the provided template. You are not required to design your own
template and must align with the broad design template given to you.

Additionally, you must submit a series of short presentations focused on
each question for 6 minutes.

## Rubric sections

##### Section 1: Knowledge Comprehension and Application

This section of the rubric consists of the required elements of the
assignment. Students should take special care to include ALL these
elements as they are often extended in the following sections

##### Section 2: Analysis, Synthesis, and Evaluation. 

This section will evaluate your ability to include critical thinking and
justification elements into your work. Often the requirements for
extension are not explicitly given, so it will be up to you to decide
how best to demonstrate what you have learned beyond the required unit
goals and curriculum. Items such as 3D models, pictures, drawings,
diagrammatic responses, notes, evidence of problem-solving, advanced
programming concepts, elegant responses, media, etc., are all available
options.

##### Section 3: Submission Guidelines 

Students are expected to provide a submission that fulfils the
requirements listed in style guides while also submitting at an
appropriate quality. Be aware that points in this section could be 2- or
4-point items. Treat them accordingly.

## Submission

All submission items should be stored in an appropriate format. For
example, code must be stored in a programmatical format so it can be
evaluated (**images of code or code copied and pasted into a document
may not be marked**)

Evidence of working material must be recorded where appropriate. For
example, to show how your robot meets a requirement, you must submit a
recording of it completing that requirement. Similarly, if you need to
show how your program can download a file from the internet and crack a
password, you must submit a recording of it doing that.

Ask the teacher if you are unsure if an element needs to be
recorded**.**

All materials must be submitted to Google Classroom.

Students are responsible for keeping backups/master copies.

"Soft Limits" are not rigidly defined limits and will be assessed on a
case-by-case basis. Ask for clarification on specific tasks

## Possible Scoring Groups are out of 2 or 4 Points.Â 

##### 2-Point Criteria - Knowledge and Understanding

Criteria assessed as 2-Points are classified as Knowledge and
Understanding criteria. These will examine and evaluate a student's
ability to effectively state facts and define terms and concepts.
Analysis and synthesis of the information will not be assessed through
these criteria.

##### 4-Point Criteria - Analysis and Synthesis and Expert Review

To show true mastery of your developing skills, students must show that
they can go beyond simple repetition of the given tasks or an
explanation of processes. Students will demonstrate their ability to
show higher-order thinking through analysis, evaluation, or linking
multiple fields of learning to solve problems in novel ways.

## Analysis and Synthesis

Analysis and Synthesis components evaluate a student's ability to
effectively review data and understandings and develop these into a
coherent and relevant statement. Analysis refers to the generating of
thoughts from interpreting the data. In contrast, synthesis combines
experience from one area with other pertinent knowledge to develop an
original and compelling solution.

##### Expert Review

Expert Reviews evaluate a student's ability to build solutions using the
skills taught during the semester. Criteria assessed as 4-Points are
classified as Analysis and Synthesis criteria. These will examine and
evaluate a student's ability to effectively review data and
understandings and develop these into a coherent and relevant statement.
Analysis refers to the generating of thoughts from interpreting the
data. In contrast, synthesis combines experience from one area with

##### Multiplier

Criteria will be combined with a **Multiplier**. While each criterion
will be scored on the 0-1-2-4 scale, the multiplier will attach relevant
worth to each criterion. Be aware of these multipliers and dedicate
appropriate time to ensure you achieve your best result.

## Achievement Standards:Â 

## Evidence of higher-order learning: 

What is it that I mean by "higher-order thinking"?

It means I want you to go beyond replicating what we do in class. I want
you to dig into your brain and understand why you did something, what
about it was great, and what could be improved.

Why is this important? Reflective thinkers can go beyond what they are
taught and can customise their learning to ben
