## Task

You have been tasked to construct an evidence guide of your learning.
The subject of the evidence guide is defaulted to the construction of
learning material for other students to consume (see below) -- however
the subject can be negotiated with the teacher for individual interest
or skills.

The subject of the evidence (the learning material) can be collaborated
on together in teams of 2 Â± 1 but the evidence guide of your learning is
individual.

An evidence guide is a centrally located document which contains
evidence of your growing knowledge and understanding of the content
taught in this course. By default you are required to submit the subject
matter that you are using to base your evidence on and your evidence
guide itself.

An evidence guide document is, generally, represented on a document that
consists of short, and sharp, responses to high level questions.
Historically, this document has been a PowerPoint document but this year
the focus is on creating Markdown Documents.

**Topics for learning material** (choose one, all continuing content
must be chosen before we can allow for duplicate choices).

### Continuing students

* argparse: a python module for handling command line input
* PyFiglet: a python module for converting strings into ASCII Text
* rich: a python library for creating rich text and beautiful formatting for command line applications
* beautiful Soup: a parsing library that allows you to read / analyse / extract data from XML and HTML documents
* requests: a HTTP library that allows you to access webpages specifically posting to forms.
* Objects as reusable namespaces
* (optional \| advanced) how to play hangman

### New year students may choose from here as well

* Functions in python: how to pass information to, use that information, and return information from a reusable function.
* For loops in python: how to iterate over a range / group of things
* While loops in python: how to iterate while some condition is true

### Each topic of learning must include the following at a minimum

* Some sort of explicit instruction on the topic
* At least 2-4 (group size +1) worked example for any major thought you are trying to express
* At least 1 practice question for each worked example.
* At least 1 challenge question which incorporates the majority the
    knowledge from above.

**Evidence Guide:**

Students must respond to the following questions:

* Question 1: What was the process you used to ensure that you would meet all of the required elements of your tutorial?
* Question 2: How did your existing knowledge and/or understanding of Information Technology helped inform your work on the tutorial.
* Question 3: How has your understanding of Information Technology changed from the start of this assignment time until now?
