## Task

You have been tasked to construct an evidence guide of your learning. The subject of the evidence guide is defaulted to the construction of a podcast on cyber security for other students to consume (see below) -- however the subject matter and medium can be negotiated with the teacher for individual consideration. 

The subject of the evidence (the learning material) can be collaborated
on together in teams of 2 Â± 1 but the evidence guide of your learning is
individual.

An evidence guide is a centrally located document which contains
evidence of your growing knowledge and understanding of the content
taught in this course. By default you are required to submit the subject
matter that you are using to base your evidence on and your evidence
guide itself.

An evidence guide document is, generally, represented on a document that
consists of short, and sharp, responses to high level questions.
Historically, this document has been a PowerPoint document but this year
the focus is on creating Markdown Documents.

**Topics for podcast** (choose one, all continuing content
must be chosen before we can allow for duplicate choices).

1. Moonlight Maze
2. BlackEnergy/Arrakis02
3. Stuxnet 
4. FancyBear
5. Industroyer/Crash Override 
6. The Shadow Brokers 
7. EternalBlue 
8. Mimikatz
9. NotPetya  and its impact on Ukraine
10. NotPetya and its impact on Maersk

### Each must podcast include the following at a minimum

* An introduction to the topic
* A summary of what the topic is about including placing it in the historic timeline
* Information regarding the topic on technology or industry

Additionally, the group must submit an annotated bibliography of their work. 

* An annotated Bibliography that represents your research. This
should have multiple resources. There is no hard minimum limit but you
should have multiple supporting pieces of evidence.
* A script where major claims are linked to the bibliography
* An audio or video podcast piece that goes for no less than 5 minutes
and no more than 10 minutes


### Evidence Guide

Individually, Students must respond to the following questions:

* Question 1: What was the process you used to ensure that you would meet all of the required elements of your tutorial?
* Question 2: How did your existing knowledge and/or understanding of Information Technology helped inform your work on the tutorial.
* Question 3: How has your understanding of Information Technology changed from the start of this assignment time until now?
