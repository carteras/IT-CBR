# Servo Motors 

## Objectives 

* Expand understanding of programming fundamentals (variables, serial printing, functions, and iteration)
* Gain a better understanding of how to use analog inputs to make decisions
* Gain an initial understanding of motors - specifically servo motors. 

### What is a servo motor?

Servo motors (or servos) are actuators that can rotate or push parts of a machine with precision. Servos generally come in two flavours: rotary actuator or linear actuator. (we will use rotary)

Servo motors have a lot of power for their size and are incredibly efficient. 



## Lab

Watch the video on google classrooms

## Practice

### Practice 1

Work along with the video

### Practice 2

A good practice project is the standard library example of sweep. You should probably try this even if you completed the task in the video

## Challenge

You know that pen test that you see on medical shows? You know the one where the Doctor asks the Patient to follow a pen being moved horizontally in front of their eyes? Let's do that but with a system. 

Create a system that has two distance sensors, and two servos. Move the two servo motors arms so that they are roughly pointing towards where you estimate where the object would be. 

You are going to want to approximate this system. It doesn't really matter if it works 100% (although it might be a good cookbook recipe (just saying))
