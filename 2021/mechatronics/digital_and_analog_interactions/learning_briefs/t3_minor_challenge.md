# Minor Challenge - Using what you know!

## What is a minor challenge?

Minor challenges are where we learn how to create something without specific instructions on what to make. These kinds of creative exploration of what we can do with our growing skills are an important part of developing understanding on a topic. 

# Challenge

## Make a thing! 

Your challenge is to build a thing that incorporates everything you've learnt so far. Your thing needs to show evidence of: 

* Digital I/O
* Analog I/O
* Motors 
* Communication between Arduino devices. 

My goal at the start of this term was to build physical things but ... here we are. If your thing is super abstract can you also include a dodgy diagram. 

### Platform

TinkerCad is perfectly fine :)

## I can't think of a thing! 

It doesn't have to be amazing or a flying shark with laser beams. Just a thing.
