## Title: Summary of cat Command for Displaying File Contents and Handling Special Filenames

cat is a Linux command used to concatenate and display files. It is commonly used to print the contents of a file to the standard output (usually the terminal).

To display the contents of a file, simply type cat followed by the filename:

```bash
cat filename.txt
```

In case a filename starts with a dash -, you need to use the -- option to avoid confusion with command options:

```bash
cat -- -filename.txt
```

This tells cat that -filename.txt is a filename and not an option.

or use `./` syntax to specify the file 

```bash
cat ./-
```

In summary, cat is a handy command for quickly displaying the contents of a file to the standard output. To handle special filenames starting with a dash, use the -- option before the filename.
