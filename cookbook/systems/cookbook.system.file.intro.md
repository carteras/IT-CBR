# Title: Summary of file Command for Identifying File Types

The file command is a useful tool in Linux for determining a file's type by examining its content and structure. This command can help you identify the type of a file without relying on its extension.

To use the file command, simply type file followed by the filename:

```bash
example.txt: ASCII text
```
