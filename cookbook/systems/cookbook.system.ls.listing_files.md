# Title: Summary of ls Command for Listing Directories and Hidden Files

`ls` is a Linux command used to list files and directories in a concise and human-readable format. To display the content of a directory, simply type ls followed by the directory path. If no path is provided, it will list the content of the current directory.

To list hidden files (those starting with a dot '.'), use the -a or --all option:


```bash
ls -a
```

Combining options is also possible. To list directories and hidden files with more detailed information, use the -l (long format) and -a options together:

```bash
ls -la
```

In summary, ls is a versatile command to list files and directories, including hidden ones, in a user-friendly format. By combining options like -a and -l, you can customize the output to fit your needs.
