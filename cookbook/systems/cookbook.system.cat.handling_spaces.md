# Title: Summary of cat Command for Handling Filenames with Spaces

When using the cat command to display the contents of a file with spaces in its name, you need to handle the spaces properly, so the shell interprets the filename correctly. Here are the common methods for handling spaces in filenames:

Quoting the filename with single or double quotes: Enclose the filename in single quotes ' or double quotes " to indicate that the spaces should be treated as part of the filename.

```bash
cat 'file name with spaces.txt'
cat "file name with spaces.txt"
```

Using the backslash \ to escape spaces: Place a backslash before each space in the filename to escape it. This tells the shell to treat the space as a literal character, not a separator.

```bash
cat file\ name\ with\ spaces.txt
```

In summary, when using cat with filenames containing spaces, either quote the filename using single or double quotes, or use a backslash to escape each space. This ensures that the shell interprets the filename correctly.
