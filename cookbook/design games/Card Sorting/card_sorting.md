# Card Sorting

It's common for people to have a pretty good, high-level, idea of what they might want to build, but how do we get down to the nitty gritty? What goes where? What relates to what? Have we really thought about all of the features that we need to get it done?

### Introduction

<!-- Introduce the topic, what is it, how does it work, include pictures -->


Card Sorting is a research technique used by designers where stakeholders come up with required features of a system/product and then organise them into related groups. It is often used in the world of User Experience Design to help Information Architects manage user expectations and meet the demands of Business Stakeholders.

Part of Designing Systems is to make sure that the System contains everything that it is supposed to contain. It's also important to understand if a features functionality is duplicated elsewhere and that the location of the feature is well understood by all stakeholders including users. 

Traditionally Card Sorting is a research method where stakeholders and user participants generate desired features onto labels/cards and then group them according to criteria that make sense to them.

**Individually:**

Design a drink vending machine.

* Each Card has one idea on it. 
* Write it on one side. Leave the other side blank
* we have 3 minutes

**Pairs:**

Form into pairs and start to categorise your cards into categories.

* Both people must agree on the categorisation
* Do this by stacking related ideas on top of each of each other. 
* You might find that you need more ideas. Feel free to write them down and add them. You must have consensus. 

**Groups of four:**

Form into groups of 4. Repeat the process from above. 

* All four people must agree. 
* Do this by stacking related ideas on top of each of each other. 
* You might find that you need more ideas. Feel free to write them down and add them. You must have consensus. 


**Class:**

Class to form at the workbench. Repeat the process from above. 

* The whole class must agree on the categorisation
