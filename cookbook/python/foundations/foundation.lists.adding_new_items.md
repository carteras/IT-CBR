## Learning Goals

*By the end of this recipe you should be able to answer the following:*

* How do you add an element to the end of the list using `append()`


## Concepts

Python lists have an inbuilt tool that allows you to append items to the end of a list. This tool is called `append(object)`.

```python
shields = ['round', 'buckler', 'heater']
print(shields)
shields[0] = 'kite'
print(shields)
shields.append('targe')
print(shields)
```

```bash
[foo@bar code]$ /usr/bin/python /home/foo/nerdstuff/code/IT-CBR/.foo/foo.py
['round', 'buckler', 'heater']
['kite', 'buckler', 'heater']
['kite', 'buckler', 'heater', 'targe']
```

## Practice Question

```python
''' given the following list add the following swords. 
mortuary
arming
long
sabre
cutlass
'''
swords = []
# your code goes here
# your code goes here
# your code goes here
# your code goes here
# your code goes here
print(swords)
```
