## Concepts

In Python, a list is a built-in data structure that is used to store a collection of items. It is an ordered and mutable sequence of elements, meaning that the elements are stored in a specific order and can be added, removed, or modified. Lists can store different types of data, including integers, strings, and other objects, and they are created using square brackets [] enclosing a comma-separated list of elements. For example, the following code creates a list of integers:

```python
swords = ['mortuary', 'arming', 'long', 'sabre']
print(swords)
```

```bash
[foo@bar code]$ /usr/bin/python /home/foo/nerdstuff/code/IT-CBR/.foo/foo.py
['mortuary', 'arming', 'long', 'sabre']
```

Here, I create a list of strings with the name of various types of swords. I then assign that list of strings to a variable called swords. 

Lists are a versatile and widely used data structure in Python, and they are used in many different applications, including data processing, machine learning, and web development.
