## Concepts

In Python, if you have a dictionary, you can count how many pairs of things it has using a special tool called the "len()" function.

```python
pets = {
  'bob': 'cat',
  'samantha': 'dog',
  'josh': 'fish',
  'olivia': 'parrot',
  'jacob': 'dog'
}
num_pets = len(pets)
print(f"How many pets do I have in my dictionary: {num_pets}")

```
