Step 1: Set the Stage

Choose a comfortable and quiet space for the brainstorming session.
Assemble a diverse group of participants with different backgrounds and perspectives.
Clearly define the problem or topic to be discussed and ensure everyone understands it.

Step 2: Establish Ground Rules

Encourage open-mindedness and emphasize that no idea is too crazy or silly.
Ask participants to refrain from criticizing or evaluating ideas during the session.
Encourage participants to build on each other's ideas, combining or modifying them as needed.

Step 3: Generate Ideas

Begin the brainstorming session by asking participants to share their ideas.
Write down all ideas on a whiteboard or paper where everyone can see them.
Use prompts or questions to stimulate creativity if the flow of ideas slows down.
Optional: Set a timer for a specific duration (e.g., 10-15 minutes) to maintain focus and momentum.

Step 4: Encourage Participation

Ensure that all participants have an opportunity to share their ideas.
Encourage quieter members to contribute by asking for their thoughts or opinions.
Use positive reinforcement to make participants feel comfortable and valued.
Step 5: Organize and Clarify Ideas

Once the brainstorming session is complete, review the generated ideas as a group.
Organize the ideas into categories or themes for easier analysis.
Ask participants to clarify or elaborate on their ideas if needed, to ensure a clear understanding.

Step 6: Evaluate and Select Ideas

After organizing and clarifying the ideas, discuss and evaluate them as a group.
Use predetermined criteria, such as feasibility, cost, or innovation, to assess the ideas.
Select the most promising ideas for further development or implementation.


## Mind mapping

Objective: Learn the basics of mind mapping and how to create an effective mind map for brainstorming and organizing ideas.


Step 1: Choose a Central Topic

Write down the central topic or problem you want to explore or solve.
Place it at the center of your paper, and draw a circle or rectangle around it.
Use a different color for the central topic to make it stand out.

Step 2: Add Main Branches

Think of the main subtopics or themes related to your central topic.
Draw branches extending from the central topic to each of these subtopics.
Write the subtopics on the branches and use different colors for each to make them easily distinguishable.

Step 3: Add Sub-branches and Details

For each main branch, identify more specific ideas, facts, or issues.
Draw sub-branches extending from the main branches and write the related ideas on them.
Continue adding sub-branches for more detailed information, always connecting them to the relevant higher-level branches.
Use a variety of colors and shapes to represent different ideas or categories.

Step 4: Use Visual Elements

Enhance your mind map with visual elements, such as symbols, icons, or images, to represent ideas or relationships.
Use different colors and line styles (e.g., dashed or curved) to differentiate between various types of connections or ideas.
This will make your mind map more engaging and easier to understand.
Step 5: Review and Revise

Once you have added all the ideas and connections, take a step back and review your mind map.
Look for any missing information, errors, or redundancies, and make the necessary adjustments.
Consider reorganizing the branches to create a more logical or intuitive structure.

## Card Sorting

Introduction:

Card sorting is a method for organizing and categorizing ideas, tasks, or information. It involves writing items on cards or sticky notes and physically arranging them into groups or categories. Card sorting is useful for brainstorming, planning, and structuring information. It can also be used to prioritize tasks based on factors such as urgency or importance.

Step 1: Prepare the Cards

Write down each idea, task, or piece of information on a separate index card or sticky note.
Ensure that the text is clear and concise, making it easy to understand and compare.
Step 2: Set Up the Sorting Area

Find a large table or wall space where you can lay out the cards and rearrange them easily.
Make sure there is enough room for all the cards and for participants to move around and discuss.
Step 3: Conduct the Card Sorting Session

Invite participants to review and discuss the cards, considering their relationships and connections.
Encourage participants to arrange the cards into groups or categories based on similarities or relationships.
Allow for open discussion and negotiation as participants work together to create the categories.
Step 4: Prioritize Tasks

Once the cards are organized into categories, discuss the priority of each task.
Consider factors such as urgency, importance, dependencies, and available resources.
Assign a priority level to each task (e.g., high, medium, or low) by using different colors or symbols.
Arrange the cards within each category based on their priority, placing higher priority tasks at the top.

Step 5: Review and Refine

After the card sorting and prioritization are complete, review the results as a group.
Look for any inconsistencies or missing information and make adjustments as needed.
Discuss any insights or patterns that emerge from the card sorting process.

Step 6: Document and Implement

Take a photo of the sorted cards or transcribe the results into a digital format for future reference.
Use the organized information and task priorities to inform decision-making, planning, and resource allocation.

## Money game "buy a feature" 

The "Buy a Feature" game is an interactive, collaborative prioritization technique that engages participants in making decisions about which features, tasks, or projects to invest in. By allocating a limited amount of play money or tokens, participants must negotiate and collaborate to decide which items are most important, helping them prioritize work effectively.

Step 1: Prepare the Cards

Write down each task, project, or feature that students need to prioritize on separate index cards or sticky notes.
Provide a brief description of each item and an estimated cost (e.g., time, effort, or resources needed).
Step 2: Set Up the Game Area

Find a large table or wall space where you can lay out the cards and provide room for participants to move around and discuss.
Display the cards with the tasks and their costs clearly visible.
Step 3: Distribute Play Money or Tokens

Provide each student with a limited amount of play money or tokens to "buy" tasks or features.
The total amount of play money should be less than the sum of all the costs, forcing participants to make choices and prioritize.
Step 4: Conduct the "Buy a Feature" Game

Invite students to review the tasks and their costs, considering the importance and impact of each item.
Encourage students to "buy" tasks or features by placing their play money or tokens on the cards.
Allow students to negotiate and collaborate, discussing their preferences and the reasons behind their choices.
Step 5: Analyze the Results

Once all the play money or tokens have been spent, review the results as a group.
Identify which tasks or features received the most investment and discuss why they were prioritized.
Step 6: Apply the Prioritization to Real Work

Use the results of the "Buy a Feature" game to inform students' real-world decisions about prioritizing work and allocating resources.
Encourage students to consider the insights gained from the game when making decisions about their projects or tasks.


## Problems

Form into pairs, use the previous ideation techniques to come up with solutions for the following problems then create visual prototypes.

You have 10 minutes for ideation for each problem and 5 minutes to create a visualisation. At the end of 15 minutes, We should rotate pairs.  

When we have completed the 5 problems (and rotations) we will present our ideas.

Problem 1: Design a simple system to automate the watering of plants using an Arduino, a moisture sensor, and a water pump.

Problem 2: Develop a security system for a locker or cabinet using an Arduino, a distance sensor, and a locking mechanism.

Problem 3: Create an interactive game for children using an Arduino, LED lights, and buttons or switches.

Problem 4: Design a temperature-controlled environment for a pet habitat using an Arduino, a temperature sensor, and a heating or cooling element.

Problem 5: Develop a system to detect and notify when a mailbox has been opened using an Arduino, a light sensor or magnetic switch, and a notification mechanism (e.g., buzzer, LED light).
