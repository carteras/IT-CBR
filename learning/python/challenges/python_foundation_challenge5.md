# Challenge name

## Required Mastery

You should have completed the mastery questions from the following sections

* reading and writing files
* requests
* pyzipper
* itertools

## Challenge

You must complete a program that creates an end to end solution for the following challenges. 

While completing your challenges you should attempt to show evidence of all of the things we've learned this term: 

* Variables
* Operations
* Functions
* Iteration
* Reading/Writing files
* Data Structures such as lists or dictionaries

As well as using some of the module tools that we've imported such as requests, such as itertools, pyzipper, etc.

#### Challenge 4

You must complete a program that creates an end to end solution for the following challenges. 

* Download challenge4.zip
* Extracts challenge4.zip
* Opens the file provided by extraction
* Gets the key from the filename
 
NOTE: End to end means that it is expected that the output of the file would be a complete flag with no erroneous details. For example, if the flag is masked with additional content like `cbrc_CTF(1234567890).txt` you must strip the `.txt` from the flag

#### Challenge 5

You must complete a program that creates an end to end solution to retrieve the flag from challenge 5. 

NOTE: End to end means that it is expected that the output of the file would be a complete flag with no erroneous details. For example, if the flag is masked with additional content like `cbrc_CTF(1234567890).txt` you must strip the `.txt` from the flag

#### Challenge 6

You must complete a program that creates an end to end solution to retrieve the flag from challenge6. Challenge 6 is PIN protected with a 4 number pin.

NOTE: End to end means that it is expected that the output of the file would be a complete flag with no erroneous details. For example, if the flag is masked with additional content like `cbrc_CTF(1234567890).txt` you must strip the `.txt` from the flag

#### Challenge 7

You must complete a program that creates an end to end solution to retrieve the flag from challenge7. Challenge 7 is password protected with a 4 alpha-numeric password.

NOTE: End to end means that it is expected that the output of the file would be a complete flag with no erroneous details. For example, if the flag is masked with additional content like `cbrc_CTF(1234567890).txt` you must strip the `.txt` from the flag

#### Challenge 8

You must complete a program that creates an end to end solution to retrieve the flag from challenge8. Challenge 8 is password protected with a common password.

NOTE: End to end means that it is expected that the output of the file would be a complete flag with no erroneous details. For example, if the flag is masked with additional content like `cbrc_CTF(1234567890).txt` you must strip the `.txt` from the flag

#### Challenge 9

You must complete a program that creates an end to end solution to retrieve the flag from challenge9. Challenge 9 is password protected with a common password which has been hashed.

NOTE: End to end means that it is expected that the output of the file would be a complete flag with no erroneous details. For example, if the flag is masked with additional content like `cbrc_CTF(1234567890).txt` you must strip the `.txt` from the flag

#### Challenge 10

You must complete a program that creates an end to end solution to retrieve the flag from challenge10. Challenge 10 is password protected with a common password which had a special character (!@#$%^&*()_+-=) added to the end of the password and has been hashed.

NOTE: End to end means that it is expected that the output of the file would be a complete flag with no erroneous details. For example, if the flag is masked with additional content like `cbrc_CTF(1234567890).txt` you must strip the `.txt` from the flag
