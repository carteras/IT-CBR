# Challenge name

## Required Mastery


You should have completed the mastery questions from the following sections

* reading and writing files
* requests
* pyzipper
* itertools

## Challenge

You must complete a program that creates an end to end solution for the following challenges. 

#### Challenge 4

You must complete a program that creates an end to end solution for the following challenges. 

* Download challenge4.zip
* Extracts challenge4.zip
* Opens the file provided by extraction
* Gets the key from the filename
 
NOTE: End to end means that it is expected that the output of the file would be a complete flag with no erroneous details. For example, if the flag is masked with additional content like `cbrc_CTF(1234567890).txt` you must strip the `.txt` from the flag

#### Challenge 5

You must complete a program that creates an end to end solution to retrieve the flag from challenge 5. 

NOTE: End to end means that it is expected that the output of the file would be a complete flag with no erroneous details. For example, if the flag is masked with additional content like `cbrc_CTF(1234567890).txt` you must strip the `.txt` from the flag

#### Challenge 6

You must complete a program that creates an end to end solution to retrieve the flag from challenge6. Challenge 6 is PIN protected with a 4 number pin.

NOTE: End to end means that it is expected that the output of the file would be a complete flag with no erroneous details. For example, if the flag is masked with additional content like `cbrc_CTF(1234567890).txt` you must strip the `.txt` from the flag

#### Challenge 7

You must complete a program that creates an end to end solution to retrieve the flag from challenge7. Challenge 7 is password protected with a 4 alpha-numeric password.

NOTE: End to end means that it is expected that the output of the file would be a complete flag with no erroneous details. For example, if the flag is masked with additional content like `cbrc_CTF(1234567890).txt` you must strip the `.txt` from the flag

#### Challenge 8

You must complete a program that creates an end to end solution to retrieve the flag from challenge8. Challenge 8 is password protected with a common password.

NOTE: End to end means that it is expected that the output of the file would be a complete flag with no erroneous details. For example, if the flag is masked with additional content like `cbrc_CTF(1234567890).txt` you must strip the `.txt` from the flag

#### Challenge 9

You must complete a program that creates an end to end solution to retrieve the flag from challenge9. Challenge 9 is password protected with a common password which has been hashed.

NOTE: End to end means that it is expected that the output of the file would be a complete flag with no erroneous details. For example, if the flag is masked with additional content like `cbrc_CTF(1234567890).txt` you must strip the `.txt` from the flag

#### Challenge 10

You must complete a program that creates an end to end solution to retrieve the flag from challenge10. Challenge 10 is password protected with a common password which had a special character (!@#$%^&*()_+-=) added to the end of the password and has been hashed.

NOTE: End to end means that it is expected that the output of the file would be a complete flag with no erroneous details. For example, if the flag is masked with additional content like `cbrc_CTF(1234567890).txt` you must strip the `.txt` from the flag
