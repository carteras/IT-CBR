### What are CTFs (Capture The Flags)

CTF (Capture The Flag) is a kind of information security competition that challenges contestants to solve a variety of tasks ranging from a scavenger hunt on wikipedia to basic programming exercises, to hacking your way into a server to steal data. In these challenges, the contestant is usually asked to find a specific piece of text that may be hidden on the server or behind a webpage. This goal is called the flag, hence the name!

### What are Flags 

This competition uses two types of flags: 

static flags that look like this: 

`cbrc_CTF(70051bfb846b5ebb9372ce4ba789f85a)`

Most other competitions use {} instead of (). I am using () because I am lazy.

The second type is a code response. You'll be asked to create a program that responds to input and produces some sort of specific output.
