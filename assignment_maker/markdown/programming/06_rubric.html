                You have submitted evidence of your evidence guide. By default, your evidence guide responses to each of the three questions selected by your teacher. However, these questions can be negotiated or reframed with your teacher.
            To achieve a passing grade (2) you must submit a serious attempt to response to the question.
            By default, your submission for the evidence guide would be on a Google Slide or PowerPoint document. This document has a maximum space allotment of 3 slides per question. Additional space can be used for introduction, indexes, and summary slides. The output can be negotiated with the teacher. Previous submissions have allowed for Google Sites, HTML, or Markdown documents.

            <li>Comprehension: Your evidence highlights that you can identify key aspects of your learning or explains to the author what you've done.</li>
