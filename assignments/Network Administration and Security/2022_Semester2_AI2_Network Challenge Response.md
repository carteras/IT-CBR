**Task**

You are tasked with designing, implementing, and documenting a solution
(in packet tracer) and responding to major unit goals.

NOTE: the intention of this assessment isn\'t for all students to submit
a complete network solution for all requirements. It is, in effect,
allowing for extension and differentiation.

**Each submission must include the following at a minimum**

-   A packet tracer file

-   Evidence that your network design completes the testable
    requirements.

-   Evidence of meeting the overall unit goals.

# Tools of Learning

### Network Design

In response to the interest in Cyber Security, Canberra College plans to
build two dedicated cybersecurity classrooms.

Additionally, you must factor in the SSICT Server Cabinet/Racks

height="1.9479166666666667in"}

The use case scenario is to create a network solution where students
(and teachers)

Your ideal network solution should have:

-   Two sets of Lab Computers that should have access to

    -   External Internet by SSICT via Wireless or Ethernet

    -   The internal Cyber Range

-   BOYD (student laptops) should have access to

    -   External Internet by SSICT via wireless

    -   Internal Cyber Range via wireless

-   Teacher devices should have

    -   External Internet by SSICT via wireless

    -   Internal Cyber Range via wireless

-   Restrictions

    -   The Cyber range should have no access to external networks

    -   Lab, Teacher, and BOYD should be on a different network and
        should be isolated from each other.

    -   Considerations for reliability, growth, etc.

-   The Cyber-range is an intranet and has the following properties

    -   We can use any IT address on the 10.1.0.0/16 subnet. However,
        you should allow for as much expansion as possible.

    -   Should provide DNS for internal domains for the cyber range

    -   Should provide DHCP for all devices connecting to the intranet

-   Test requirements:

    -   Demonstrate connectivity between:

        -   A LAB PC

            -   Can access the external gateway

            -   Can access bushranger.playground.cbrc

        -   A BOYD Laptop

            -   Can access the external gateway

            -   Can access bushranger.playground.cbrc

        -   A Teacher Laptop

            -   Can access the external gateway

            -   Can access bushranger.playground.cbrc

NOTE: PCs on packet tracer can only have one network device. You\'ll
need to use a server if you want multiple network devices (Network
Interface Cards) on the same computer.

You will be assessed on:

-   Evidence of technical understanding

-   Depth of solution provided

-   Effectiveness/efficiency of network design

Your packet tracer solution must include labels/notes describing each
subnet, including:

-   Subnet range

-   Gateway

-   DNS

-   DHCP

-   DHCP range and size

### Technical evidence

One of the requirements of a Network Engineer is to produce
documentation that describes what it is they did, how they did it, and
how it can be replicated. In addition, you are required to analyse what
you did and provide, where applicable, an evaluation of why your
approach was better than others.

You are not required to create evidence for all elements in your
solution. Instead, you must create evidence that responds to the
following unit goals.

-   Justify your design process and how it relates to the network
    solution\'s design and configuration regarding handling the
    intranet\'s significant features (lab1, lab2, BOYD, and Teacher
    Laptops) and access to cyber range (DNS, DHCP,
    bushranger.playground.cbrc).

-   Evaluate different strategies or approaches in creating the most
    effective and secure network between our intranet, SSICT intranet,
    and the Internet.

## Rubric sections

##### Section 1: Knowledge Comprehension and Application

This section of the rubric consists of the required elements of the
assignment. Students should take special care to include ALL these
elements as they are often extended in the following sections

##### Section 2: Analysis, Synthesis, and Evaluation. 

This section will evaluate your ability to include critical thinking and
justification elements into your work. Often the requirements for
extension are not explicitly given, so it will be up to you to decide
how best to demonstrate what you have learned beyond the required unit
goals and curriculum. Items such as 3D models, pictures, drawings,
diagrammatic responses, notes, evidence of problem-solving, advanced
programming concepts, elegant responses, media, etc., are all available
options.

##### Section 3: Submission Guidelines 

Students are expected to provide a submission that fulfils the
requirements listed in style guides while also submitting at an
appropriate quality. Be aware that points in this section could be 2- or
4-point items. Treat them accordingly.

## Submission

All submission items should be stored in an appropriate format. For
example, code must be stored in a programmatical format so it can be
evaluated (**images of code or code copied and pasted into a document
may not be marked**)

Evidence of working material must be recorded where appropriate. For
example, to show how your robot meets a requirement, you must submit a
recording of it completing that requirement. Similarly, if you need to
show how your program can download a file from the internet and crack a
password, you must submit a recording of it doing that.

Ask the teacher if you are unsure if an element needs to be
recorded**.**

All materials must be submitted to Google Classroom.

Students are responsible for keeping backups/master copies.

"Soft Limits" are not rigidly defined limits and will be assessed on a
case-by-case basis. Ask for clarification on specific tasks

## Possible Scoring Groups are out of 2 or 4 Points.Â 

##### 2-Point Criteria - Knowledge and Understanding

Criteria assessed as 2-Points are classified as Knowledge and
Understanding criteria. These will examine and evaluate a student's
ability to effectively state facts and define terms and concepts.
Analysis and synthesis of the information will not be assessed through
these criteria.

##### 4-Point Criteria - Analysis and Synthesis and Expert Review

To show true mastery of your developing skills, students must show that
they can go beyond simple repetition of the given tasks or an
explanation of processes. Students will demonstrate their ability to
show higher-order thinking through analysis, evaluation, or linking
multiple fields of learning to solve problems in novel ways.

## Analysis and Synthesis

Analysis and Synthesis components evaluate a student's ability to
effectively review data and understandings and develop these into a
coherent and relevant statement. Analysis refers to the generating of
thoughts from interpreting the data. In contrast, synthesis combines
experience from one area with other pertinent knowledge to develop an
original and compelling solution.

##### Expert Review

Expert Reviews evaluate a student's ability to build solutions using the
skills taught during the semester. Criteria assessed as 4-Points are
classified as Analysis and Synthesis criteria. These will examine and
evaluate a student's ability to effectively review data and
understandings and develop these into a coherent and relevant statement.
Analysis refers to the generating of thoughts from interpreting the
data. In contrast, synthesis combines experience from one area with
other pertinent knowledge to develop an original and compelling

##### Multiplier

Criteria will be combined with a **Multiplier**. While each criterion
will be scored on the 0-1-2-4 scale, the multiplier will attach relevant
worth to each criterion. Be aware of these multipliers and dedicate
appropriate time to ensure you achieve your best result.

## Achievement Standards:Â 

## Evidence of higher-order learning: 

What is it that I mean by "higher-order thinking"?

It means I want you to go beyond replicating what we do in class. I want
you to dig into your brain and understand why you did something, what
about it was great, and what could be improved.

Why is this important? Reflective thinkers can go beyond what they are
taught and can customise their learning to ben
