# Task

You have been tasked with creating a showcase of your learning. Your
showcase will use the focus on a Tool of Learning, the TryHackMe
website, to learn different aspects of cyber security. The default
showcase will be an A2 poster of your learning and one recorded
presentation for a general audience.

# Tool of learning

The focus of this body of work **will be using
[TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/).** TryHackMe is an online platform
that teaches cyber security through short, gamified, real-world labs.

TryHackMe has a free account. However, it limits the number of available
learning paths and how many hours a day you can spend on the attack box
(**1 hour a day**). **You will need to do some work daily** to complete
enough of the work to move forward. It is impossible to cram this in at
the last minute.

# Tasks for learning and submission

Your in-class activities are to complete a range of rooms from Try Hack
Me. You have to complete at least six rooms. Students from 2021 who
completed some of these tasks need to complete new tasks. Students
who've completed all of these tasks elsewhere can negotiate a secondary
task.

You must complete

-   Tutorial - https://tryhackme.com/room/tutorial

-   Starting Out In Cyber Sec -
    https://tryhackme.com/room/startingoutincybersec

-   Introductory Researching -
    https://tryhackme.com/room/introtoresearch

NOTE: some of these components will consume a lot more time than others.
Do not assume they are all easy mode

You are required to show evidence of completion. Ideally, this should be

screenshots of your completed sections.

# Showcase Responses

Your poster and presentations must respond to three statements and
present different levels of information to describe what it is you
learnt and how that knowledge can be used in cyber security.

The statements will be provided in the rubric below. You must address
your responses to the three audiences:

1.  Poster -- summarise your learning for general audiences in a
    condensed writing environment

2.  General audience presentation -- simulates presenting your work and
    learning to a general audience and allows for some extrapolation

Your general audience presentation should be no more than 5 minutes.

##### Section 1: Knowledge Comprehension, and Application

This section of the rubric consists of the required elements of the
assignment. Students should take special care to include ALL these
elements as they are often extended in the following sections

##### Section 2: Analysis, Synthesis, and Evaluation. 

This section will evaluate your ability to include critical thinking and
justification elements into your work. Often the requirements for
extension are not explicitly given, so it will be up to the you to
decide how best to demonstrate what you have learned beyond the required
unit goals and curriculum. Items such as 3D models, pictures, drawings,
diagrammatic responses, notes, evidence of problem solving, advanced
programming concepts, elegant responses, media, etc., are all available
options.

##### Section 3: Submission Guidelines 

For this section, students will be expected to provide a submission
which fulfills all of the formatting and citation requirements listed in
this assessment sheet but also that the submission is of a professional
quality. Be aware, points in this section could be 2- or 4-point items.
Treat them accordingly.

## Submission

All submission items should be stored in an appropriate format. For
example, code must be stored in a programmatical format so it can be
evaluated (**images of code, or code simply copied and pasted into a
document, will not be marked**)

Evidence of working material must be recorded where appropriate. For
example, if you are showing how your game meets some requirement, you
must submit a recording. Similarly, if you are showing how your robot
meets a requirement, you must record it.

If you are unsure if an element needs to be recorded, **ask the
teacher.**

All materials must be submitted to google classrooms.

Students are responsible for keeping backups/master-copies.

"Soft Limits" are not rigidly defined limits and will be assessed on a
case-by-case basis. Ask for clarification for specific tasks

## Possible Scoring Groups are out of 2 or 4 Points. 

**2-Point Criteria - Knowledge and Understanding**

Criteria assessed as 2-Points are classified as Knowledge and
Understanding criteria. These will examine and evaluate a student's
ability to state facts and define terms and concepts effectively.
Analysis and synthesis of the information will not be assessed through
these criteria.

**4-Point Criteria - Analysis and Synthesis and Expert Review**

To show true mastery of your developing skills, students must show that
they can go beyond simple repetition of the given tasks or an
explanation of processes. Students will show their ability to show
higher order thinking through analysis, evaluation, or the linking of
multiple fields of learning to solve problems in novel ways.

**Analysis and Synthesis**

Analysis and Synthesis components evaluate a student's ability to
effectively review data and understandings and develop these into a
coherent and relevant statement. Analysis refers to the generating of
thoughts from interpreting the data, while synthesis refers to combining
analysis of the data with other relevant information to develop an
original and effective idea.

**Expert Review**

Expert Reviews evaluate a student's ability to build solutions using the
skills that have been taught during the semester. Criteria assessed as
4-Points are classified as Analysis and Synthesis criteria. These will
examine and evaluate a student's ability to effectively review data and
understandings and develop these into a coherent and relevant statement.
Analysis refers to the generating of thoughts from interpreting the
data, while synthesis refers to combining analysis of the data with
other relevant information to develop an original and effective idea.

**Multiplier**

Criteria will be combined with a **Multiplier**. While each criterion
will be scored on the 0-1-2-4 scale, the multiplier will attach relevant
worth to each criterion. Be aware of these multipliers and dedicate
appropriate time to ensure you achieve your best result.

**Achievement Standards: **

##### Evidence of higher order learning: 

What is it that I mean by "higher order thinking"?

It means I want you to go beyond just replicating what we do in class. I
want you to dig into your brain and understand why you did something,
what about it was great, what could be improved.

Why is this important? Reflective thinkers can go beyond what they are
taught and can customise their learning to ben
