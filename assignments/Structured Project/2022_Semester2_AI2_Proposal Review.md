**Task**

You have been tasked to complete various activities: a series of peer
reviews, a self-reflection, and improvements to your lightweight design
proposal.

.**Each must include the following at a minimum**

-   Review three peer reviews

-   Complete a reflection on your submission based on your peer reviews

-   Submit at least three improvements to your Lightweight Design
    Proposal.

**The Thing**

One of the most critical things in Industry is the ability to reflect on
the work given and use those reflections to improve our work. However,
this process is complicated due to the limited time on task and the
closed curtain styles of education.

# Tool of learning

### Peer review

You will be required to select three students\' work to review. I highly
recommend that you select three bodies of work that you feel would
benefit your learning. You will receive lightweight marking sheets to
help guide your review process.

### Self-reflection

You will use the information from the reviews to inform an analysis of
your work. You may identify things that you feel will improve your
project by adding them. You may also find items you now see in a
different context suggest that something isn\'t as good as you thought
it might have been.

### Project planning improvements

Lastly, you must submit improvements to your design proposals. These
improvements must highlight why you have chosen to make them. These
highlights must come from your self-reflection, peer-review, or ideally,
both.

In the rare case that you can\'t find any improvements from your cohort,
you may negotiate to extend your project design to include more detailed
design under discussion with your teacher.

## Rubric sections

##### Section 1: Knowledge Comprehension and Application

This section of the rubric consists of the required elements of the
assignment. Students should take special care to include ALL these
elements as they are often extended in the following sections

##### Section 2: Analysis, Synthesis, and Evaluation. 

This section will evaluate your ability to include critical thinking and
justification elements into your work. Often the requirements for
extension are not explicitly given, so it will be up to you to decide
how best to demonstrate what you have learned beyond the required unit
goals and curriculum. Items such as 3D models, pictures, drawings,
diagrammatic responses, notes, evidence of problem-solving, advanced
programming concepts, elegant responses, media, etc., are all available
options.

##### Section 3: Submission Guidelines 

Students are expected to provide a submission that fulfils the
requirements listed in style guides while also submitting at an
appropriate quality. Be aware that points in this section could be 2- or
4-point items. Treat them accordingly.

## Submission

All submission items should be stored in an appropriate format. For
example, code must be stored in a programmatical format so it can be
evaluated (**images of code or code copied and pasted into a document
may not be marked**)

Evidence of working material must be recorded where appropriate. For
example, to show how your robot meets a requirement, you must submit a
recording of it completing that requirement. Similarly, if you need to
show how your program can download a file from the internet and crack a
password, you must submit a recording of it doing that.

Ask the teacher if you are unsure if an element needs to be
recorded**.**

All materials must be submitted to Google Classroom.

Students are responsible for keeping backups/master copies.

"Soft Limits" are not rigidly defined limits and will be assessed on a
case-by-case basis. Ask for clarification on specific tasks

## Possible Scoring Groups are out of 2 or 4 Points. 

##### 2-Point Criteria - Knowledge and Understanding

Criteria assessed as 2-Points are classified as Knowledge and
Understanding criteria. These will examine and evaluate a student's
ability to effectively state facts and define terms and concepts.
Analysis and synthesis of the information will not be assessed through
these criteria.

##### 4-Point Criteria - Analysis and Synthesis and Expert Review

To show true mastery of your developing skills, students must show that
they can go beyond simple repetition of the given tasks or an
explanation of processes. Students will demonstrate their ability to
show higher-order thinking through analysis, evaluation, or linking
multiple fields of learning to solve problems in novel ways.

## Analysis and Synthesis

Analysis and Synthesis components evaluate a student's ability to
effectively review data and understandings and develop these into a
coherent and relevant statement. Analysis refers to the generating of
thoughts from interpreting the data. In contrast, synthesis combines
experience from one area with other pertinent knowledge to develop an
original and compelling solution.

##### Expert Review

Expert Reviews evaluate a student's ability to build solutions using the
skills taught during the semester. Criteria assessed as 4-Points are
classified as Analysis and Synthesis criteria. These will examine and
evaluate a student's ability to effectively review data and
understandings and develop these into a coherent and relevant statement.
Analysis refers to the generating of thoughts from interpreting the
data. In contrast, synthesis combines experience from one area with

##### Multiplier

Criteria will be combined with a **Multiplier**. While each criterion
will be scored on the 0-1-2-4 scale, the multiplier will attach relevant
worth to each criterion. Be aware of these multipliers and dedicate
appropriate time to ensure you achieve your best result.

## Achievement Standards: 

## Evidence of higher-order learning: 

What is it that I mean by "higher-order thinking"?

It means I want you to go beyond replicating what we do in class. I want
you to dig into your brain and understand why you did something, what
about it was great, and what could be improved.

Why is this important? Reflective thinkers can go beyond what they are
taught and can customise their learning to ben
