# Task:

**Task**

You have been tasked to construct an evidence guide of your learning.
The subject of the evidence guide is defaulted to the construction of a
podcast on cyber security for other students to consume (see below) \--
however the subject matter and medium can be negotiated with the teacher
for individual consideration.

The subject of the evidence (the learning material) can be collaborated
on together in teams of 2 ± 1 but the evidence guide of your learning is
individual.

An evidence guide is a centrally located document which contains
evidence of your growing knowledge and understanding of the content
taught in this course. By default you are required to submit the subject
matter that you are using to base your evidence on and your evidence
guide itself.

An evidence guide document is, generally, represented on a document that
consists of short, and sharp, responses to high level questions.
Historically, this document has been a PowerPoint document but this year
the focus is on creating Markdown Documents.

**Topics for podcast** (choose one, all continuing content must be
chosen before we can allow for duplicate choices).

1.  Moonlight Maze

2.  BlackEnergy/Arrakis02

3.  Stuxnet

4.  FancyBear

5.  Industroyer/Crash Override

6.  The Shadow Brokers

7.  EternalBlue

8.  Mimikatz

9.  NotPetya and its impact on Ukraine

10. NotPetya and its impact on Maersk

**Each must podcast include the following at a minimum**

-   An introduction to the topic

-   A summary of what the topic is about including placing it in the
    historic timeline

-   Information regarding the topic on technology or industry

Additionally, the group must submit an annotated bibliography of their
work.

-   An annotated Bibliography that represents your research. This should
    have multiple resources. There is no hard minimum limit but you
    should have multiple supporting pieces of evidence.

-   A script where major claims are linked to the bibliography

-   An audio or video podcast piece that goes for no less than 5 minutes
    and no more than 10 minutes

**Evidence Guide**

Individually, Students must respond to the following questions:

-   Question 1: What was the process you used to ensure that you would
    meet all of the required elements of the Podcast? What were the
    elements, how did you know this?

-   Question 2: How did your existing knowledge and/or understanding of
    this topic within Information Technology help inform your work on
    this work?

-   Question 3: How has your understanding of this topic within
    Information Technology changed over the course of this assignment?

Details about how to answer these questions can be found in the rubric.

##### Section 1: Knowledge Comprehension, and Application

This section of the rubric consists of the required elements of the
assignment. Students should take special care to include ALL these
elements as they are often extended in the following sections

##### Section 2: Analysis, Synthesis, and Evaluation. 

This section will evaluate your ability to include critical thinking and
justification elements into your work. Often the requirements for
extension are not explicitly given, so it will be up to the you to
decide how best to demonstrate what you have learned beyond the required
unit goals and curriculum. Items such as 3D models, pictures, drawings,
diagrammatic responses, notes, evidence of problem solving, advanced
programming concepts, elegant responses, media, etc., are all available
options.

##### Section 3: Submission Guidelines 

For this section, students will be expected to provide a submission
which fulfills all of the formatting and citation requirements listed in
this assessment sheet but also that the submission is of a professional
quality. Be aware, points in this section could be 2- or 4-point items.
Treat them accordingly.

## Submission

All submission items should be stored in an appropriate format. For
example, code must be stored in a programmatical format so it can be
evaluated (**images of code, or code simply copied and pasted into a
document, will not be marked**)

Evidence of working material must be recorded where appropriate. For
example, if you are showing how your game meets some requirement, you
must submit a recording. Similarly, if you are showing how your robot
meets a requirement, you must record it.

If you are unsure if an element needs to be recorded, **ask the
teacher.**

**All materials must be submitted to google classrooms.**

Students are responsible for keeping backups/master-copies.

*"Soft Limits" are not rigidly defined limits and will be assessed on a
case-by-case basis. Ask for clarification for specific tasks*

## Possible Scoring Groups are out of 2 or 4 Points. 

**2-Point Criteria - Knowledge and Understanding**

*Criteria assessed as 2-Points are classified as Knowledge and
Understanding criteria. These will examine and evaluate a student's
ability to state facts and define terms and concepts effectively.
Analysis and synthesis of the information will not be assessed through
these criteria.*

**4-Point Criteria - Analysis and Synthesis and Expert Review**

*To show true mastery of your developing skills, students must show that
they can go beyond simple repetition of the given tasks or an
explanation of processes. Students will show their ability to show
higher order thinking through analysis, evaluation, or the linking of
multiple fields of learning to solve problems in novel ways.*

**Analysis and Synthesis**

*Analysis and Synthesis components evaluate a student's ability to
effectively review data and understandings and develop these into a
coherent and relevant statement. Analysis refers to the generating of
thoughts from interpreting the data, while synthesis refers to combining
analysis of the data with other relevant information to develop an
original and effective idea.*

**Expert Review**

*Expert Reviews evaluate a student's ability to build solutions using
the skills that have been taught during the semester. Criteria assessed
as 4-Points are classified as Analysis and Synthesis criteria. These
will examine and evaluate a student's ability to effectively review data
and understandings and develop these into a coherent and relevant
statement. Analysis refers to the generating of thoughts from
interpreting the data, while synthesis refers to combining analysis of
the data with other relevant information to develop an original and
effective idea.*

**Multiplier**

Criteria will be combined with a **Multiplier**. While each criterion
will be scored on the 0-1-2-4 scale, the multiplier will attach relevant
worth to each criterion. Be aware of these multipliers and dedicate
appropriate time to ensure you achieve your best result.

**Evidence of higher order learning:**

What is it that I mean by "higher order thinking"?

It means I want you to go beyond just replicating what we do in class. I
want you to dig into your brain and understand why you did something,
what about it was great, what could be improved.

Why is this important? Reflective thinkers are able to go beyond what
they are taught and can customise their learning to ben
